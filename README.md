Custom Keyboard built with SwiftUI
Innovative and meticulously crafted, my custom keyboard built using SwiftUI is a testament to my proficiency in mobile app development. Inspired by Microsoft's SwiftKey, this keyboard seamlessly integrates sleek design with user-friendly functionality. The implementation in SwiftUI ensures a responsive and visually appealing interface, creating an immersive typing experience. The keyboard, a product of my passion for coding and commitment to excellence, showcases not only my technical skills but also a keen understanding of user-centric design principles. This project underscores my ability to bring creativity and practicality together, reinforcing my dedication to pushing the boundaries of mobile technology.
